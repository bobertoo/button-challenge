# Cool Button

[cool-button](https://cool-button.herokuapp.com/)

My application has a button that runs away from the cursor touches it. I thought this was an out of the box idea and it turned out pretty cool.

I am good at figuring out creative solutions for problems and I really like creating things that have. I am excited about becoming a more accomplished programmer and I would like to improve everything! My ideal intern project would be something along the lines of creating an integration of Button on a client's product that has an interesting twist, kinda like the runaway button that I created.

I think that Button has a great platform that I could learn and contribute a lot to. I am excited to work with a product that is being used by a lot of the top tech companies and at a place that is considered by Business Insider and Crain's as one of the best places to work. I just can't wait to do some coding with some great people!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
