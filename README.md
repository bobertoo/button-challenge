# Cool Button

[cool-button](https://cool-button.herokuapp.com/)

My application has a button that runs away from the cursor when the cursor touches it. I thought this was an out of the box idea and it turned out pretty cool.

I am good at figuring out creative solutions for problems. I‘m excited about becoming a more accomplished programmer and would like to improve my coding skills. My ideal intern project would be to explore different ways of integrating Button’s services on a client's product in interesting and innovative ways, kind of like the runaway button that I created.

I’d like to intern at Button to learn and contribute to your great platform while working alongside Button’s talented team. Button provides some very unique challenges in the way that it connects businesses together through the push of a button since each client will have a different web setup with it’s own nuances and difficulties to wrangle. I am excited to have the chance to take on these difficult challenges in a supportive environment with great people backing me up.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
